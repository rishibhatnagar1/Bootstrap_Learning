#Bootstrap Learnings 


Bootstrap needs a container class or a container-fluid class.
A container class proveds a responsive fixed width container while container-fluid provides a full width container. There are not nestible. So basically, one with the fluid is going to be much better when someone can move your browser in various lengths and breadths.

Grids:
Upto 12 columns are allowed across the page. They can be grouped etc. 

Following are the classes:
xs for phones
sm for tablets
md for desktops
lg for large desktops, like my iMac


Use for example : .col-sm-4 for column taking 4 parts of the grid, 8 for 8 parts, these grids are out of 12 possible grids.
All of the below are classes btw , use them with ".className"

<small> used to create lighter secondary text in addition to <h1> - <h6>

<mark> is used to highlight a text

<abbr> used to dotted undeline something

<blockquote> used for creating shadow kind of a thing of left /right side of the text. <blockquote-reverse> I will probably use this to maybe take recommendations/testimonials from people I have worked with and display it on the website.

<dl> makes a description list, more like what <ul> does, but this is more interesting than that for sure!

<code> is what I have been looking for a long time, this is frikking hot. Remember how people write codes on famous website, it appears so cool there, it has a similar function here. Add all the code between <code></code>

<kbd> could be used for buttons, markers, something like that

<pre> adds line breaks to  the HTML

Contextual colors may be added using various tags like bg-primary/success/info/warning/danger etc. and it looks brilliant. Not kidding.

<pre-scrollable> Can be used to make a long article/code etc to be at a max-heigh of 350px with a scroll bar on the y axis side. Intersting right?

<list-inline> puts all the elements in <ul> side by side. Love it now.

<thumbnail> this class

<jumbotron> makes everythin stand out, beautifully!
  <div class="page-header">
    <h1>Example Page Header</h1>      
  </div>
